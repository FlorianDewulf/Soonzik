I made the Backend and Frontend of the Website, the project was made during 2-3 years and I learned RoR by doing this project so some files can be ugly (and it's a school project, so sometimes... it was during a rush. Btw, it was my first Framework too).
I don't know if it works, it's more for code review.
It works with AngularJS and API calls.
The other applications were not my work so I don't know if it works / it's clean.
